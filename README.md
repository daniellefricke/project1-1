# PROJECT 1: HANGMAN
Have a player enter a word under a selected category that will be guessed during the game. The word is then hidden and represented by blank dashes. The second player then chooses letters, which are revealed if present. If second player guesses correctly before their lives reach 0, second player wins and gets a point. First player wins when the second player lose all their lives. Both players can keep playing without having to refresh the page.
